/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CropSafe application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a flexible data shape during prototyping while strictly controlling data access.
 * It leverages denormalization to ensure authorization checks are efficient and independent, avoiding
 * costly `get()` calls. The security model focuses on ownership for storage locations and uses that
 * ownership information, denormalized onto crop batches, to manage access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /storageLocations/{storageLocationId}: Stores storage location data.
 * - /cropBatches/{cropBatchId}: Stores crop batch data, with a denormalized `storageLocationId` for authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public listing of all collections is disallowed. List operations are secured based on ownership.
 * - The rules prioritize authorization and relational integrity checks, omitting detailed data validation
 *   to allow for rapid prototyping.
 * - Ownership of storage locations is determined by the path, and crop batches inherit access based on their
 *   associated storage location. This avoids complex queries for authorization.
