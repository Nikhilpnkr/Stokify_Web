## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#8FBC8F) to evoke a sense of nature and freshness.
- Background color: Muted light-brown (#F5F5DC), providing a calm and organic feel.
- Accent color: A darker shade of brown (#A0522D) used sparingly for call-to-action elements and important notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, blends modern readability with approachability, enhancing both headings and paragraph text. Its gentle design offers a welcoming feel for extended reading.
- Use icons that are nature and farming-related, like leaves, crops, and warehouse structures. Icons should have a clean, simple design style to easily understand and quickly recognize key details.
- The layout is designed with ample white space, improving readability and reducing clutter. Storage details use organized blocks for clear information, simplifying tracking storage time and optimizing content arrangement.
- Subtle animations can be integrated to enhance interactions such as batch uploads, showing progress updates when new information is added, and enhancing storage visualizations for better communication.
