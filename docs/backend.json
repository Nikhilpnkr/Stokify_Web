    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage crop batches and storage locations for the CropSafe application. It prioritizes Authorization Independence by storing all necessary authorization data directly within the documents, avoiding hierarchical dependencies and complex `get()` calls in security rules. Access control is implemented by leveraging an 'ownerId' field on each document. This structure supports secure `list` operations by ensuring that the security rules can query based on this 'ownerId'."
